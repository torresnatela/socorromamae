- 2025-11-16 16:00 - Created Turborepo scaffolding with Next.js app, shared packages, pnpm scripts, and Supabase/Vercel health tooling to unlock Story 1.1 foundations.
- 2025-11-16 18:00 - Reset project to a single Next.js app per user request; removed Turborepo/workspaces and configured simple Supabase health check in `/api/health`.
