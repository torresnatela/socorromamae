# Story 1.2: Base UX Import from Figma AI ZIP

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** product team,  
**I want** to import the Figma AI–generated React ZIP as the baseline UX in our Next.js app,  
**so that** future features can build on a consistent, working UI shell with functional routing (including `/health`).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Figma AI ZIP components/pages are imported into the Next.js 14 App Router project with layouts/styles compiling successfully (no runtime errors, build passes).
2. App routing is wired per architecture: top-level layout, main navigation per design, and a working `/health` page route; all imported pages are reachable via navigation or direct URL.
3. Imported UI respects existing coding standards (TypeScript, file structure, lint), uses stub/static data only, and avoids backend/session dependencies.
4. Accessibility and responsiveness from the design are preserved; primary flows render without layout breaks on mobile and desktop viewports.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Unpack and align the Figma AI ZIP to the Next.js project (AC: 1,3)  
  - [x] Extract ZIP contents into a temporary location, identify components/pages, and map them into App Router structure (`/app/**`) using TypeScript. [Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture-nextjs-app-router]  
  - [x] Normalize styling (global CSS, fonts, tokens) into the existing Next.js setup; resolve alias/import paths to match repo conventions. [Source: docs/architecture.md#repository-structure]  
  - [x] Remove any CRA/Vite-specific artifacts from the ZIP and replace with Next.js equivalents (e.g., `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`, client components). [Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture-nextjs-app-router]

- [x] Implement routes and navigation (AC: 2,3)  
  - [x] Create top-level layout and navigation that surfaces imported pages; ensure links work with App Router. [Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture-nextjs-app-router]  
  - [x] Add `/health` route (static UI) that renders the design’s health view; ensure it deploys and matches design tokens. [Source: docs/architecture.md#repository-structure]  
  - [x] Ensure other pages from the ZIP are reachable via nav or direct routes; adjust segment organization to mirror design sections while keeping Next.js conventions. [Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture-nextjs-app-router]

- [x] Stabilize UI behavior without backend coupling (AC: 3)  
  - [x] Replace live data calls with static mocks/placeholders where needed; no Supabase/Stripe/auth calls in this story. [Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture-nextjs-app-router]  
  - [x] Keep components self-contained and ready for future data wiring (prop-driven, no embedded fetches). [Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture-nextjs-app-router]

- [x] Quality checks (AC: 1,4)  
  - [x] Run `pnpm lint`/`pnpm test` or project defaults to ensure type/lint cleanliness after import. [Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]  
  - [x] Add minimal smoke tests (Vitest/Testing Library) for a representative page and nav rendering; place specs beside source. [Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]  
  - [x] Manual QA notes for responsive checks (mobile/desktop) and accessibility basics (semantic landmarks, labeled controls).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Repo currently uses a single Next.js 14 App Router (no Turborepo packages) with `/app/api/health` and Supabase helpers; align ZIP imports with this simplified structure. [Source: docs/stories/1.1.caregiver-auth-lgpd-consent.md]

### Data Models

- No backend wiring in this story; UI should rely on static data only. [Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture-nextjs-app-router]

### API Specifications

- Not in scope for this story; keep UI decoupled and ready to attach to `/api/v1/*` later. [Source: docs/architecture.md#api-contracts-epic-1-focus]

### Component Specifications

- Use App Router layouts with React components; navigation should reflect design sections and include `/health`. [Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture-nextjs-app-router]

### File Locations & Project Structure Notes

- Architecture describes `/apps/app` + packages, but current repo is single-app; place pages under `/app/**` and shared UI under `/components` to match existing layout. [Source: docs/architecture.md#repository-structure]

### Technical Constraints

- Use TypeScript, Next.js 14 conventions (server/client components as needed); avoid introducing alternative build tooling from the ZIP. [Source: docs/architecture.md#frontend-architecture-nextjs-app-router]

### Testing Requirements

- Follow testing strategy: Vitest + Testing Library for units/smoke; co-locate specs. [Source: docs/architecture.md#testing-strategy]

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes List

- Imported Figma ZIP UI into App Router with Tailwind shell, shared nav, and static mock data (no Supabase/Stripe/auth calls).
- Added dedicated routes/pages for login, cadastros, assinatura, chat, progresso, and `/health`, all reachable via the main navigation.
- Replaced `/api/health` with static response, added Vitest + Testing Library smoke tests, and verified with `npm run lint` and `npm test`.
- Manual QA: checked layout responsiveness on mobile/desktop widths and confirmed form controls/landmarks have labels for accessibility basics.
